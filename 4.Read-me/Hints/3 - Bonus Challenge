The React documentation I have in mind here is this page: https://react.dev/learn/updating-arrays-in-state

Pay particular attention to the parts that talk about "mutating" state or state "mutation" (search for those words). 

"While mutating state can work in some cases, we donâ€™t recommend it. You should treat the state value you have access to in a render as read-only."
